## Installing Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi

To install Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS and flash it onto an SD card.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to your network and power it on.
3. Access it via SSH and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install homeassistant
```

4. Start Home Assistant with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start home-assistant@homeassistant.service
```

5. Access the web interface at `http://<your-raspberry-pi-ip>:8123` in your browser.

## Installing Home Assistant on Kubernetes with k3s

To install Home Assistant on a Kubernetes cluster using k3s:

1. Install k3s on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Create a new namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace home-assistant
```

3. Define the deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: home-assistant
  namespace: home-assistant
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: home-assistant
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: home-assistant
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: home-assistant
        image: homeassistant/home-assistant:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8123
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /config
      volumes:
      - name: config
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: home-assistant-config
```

4. Create a persistent volume claim:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: home-assistant-config
  namespace: home-assistant
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

5. Apply the configurations:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
```

6. Access the web interface at `http://<your-kubernetes-node-ip>:<node-port>`.

Optionally, you can expose Home Assistant to the internet using a Kubernetes ingress controller or a load balancer.
