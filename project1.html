{% endhighlight %}

<p>Access the Home Assistant web interface by navigating to <code>http://&lt;your-raspberry-pi-ip-address&gt;:8123</code> in your web browser.</p>

<h2>Installing Home Assistant on Kubernetes Cluster using k3s:</h2>
<p>To install Home Assistant on a Kubernetes cluster using k3s, follow these steps:</p>

<p>Install k3s on your Kubernetes cluster. You can follow the k3s installation guide for your specific platform.</p>

<p>Create a new namespace for Home Assistant:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
kubectl create namespace home-assistant
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Create a new deployment:</p>
{% highlight yaml %}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: home-assistant
  namespace: home-assistant
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: home-assistant
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: home-assistant
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: home-assistant
        image: homeassistant/home-assistant:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8123
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /config
      volumes:
      - name: config
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: home-assistant-config
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Create a Persistent Volume Claim for configuration storage:</p>
{% highlight yaml %}
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: home-assistant-config
  namespace: home-assistant
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Apply the configurations:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Access the Home Assistant web interface by navigating to <code>http://&lt;your-kubernetes-node-ip-address&gt;:&lt;node-port&gt;</code> in your web browser, where <code>&lt;node-port&gt;</code> is the port that you specified in your Kubernetes service definition.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can expose Home Assistant to the internet using a Kubernetes ingress controller or a load balancer.</p>
